# NowTV React Interview

## Commands

- **npm start**: Runs the web application in developer mode
- **npm test**: Executes Jest tests that have the `.test.js` extension

## Tasks

Feel free to create new files to help you complete these tasks. Please ask before downloading any external libraries, most will be fine.

1. In `service.js`, utilise the 'APIs' provided by `data.js` to create a promise resolving to an array of chatlog messages in the following format, sorted by time.

```json
[
  {
    "messageId": "12356",
    "userId": "613651251",
    "fullName": "Robin Balmforth",
    "timestamp": "2017-02-23T14:57:20.629Z",
    "email": "robin@example.com",
    "message": "Hello, World!",
    "avatar": null
  },
  ...
]
```
(Do not modify `data.js` to achieve this, but if you think there's an issue ask the developer helping you!)

2. Create a view of this dataset, with the root of your React application starting in `App.js`. Including:
  - Display the `avatar` where applicable
  - Display the `email` on hover
  - Format the timestamp to be human readable

3. Zip test back up and send it back to recruiter.

4. Bonus Questions:
  - How would you achieve this with Redux?
    - create store, initial data and any middleware.
    - actions types for fetching, on success and on error created and call the api end points.
    - create reducers to update the store, depending on which action type is called.
    - in the chatlog component call action to start the process of calling end point.
  
  - How would you handle an error from the API?
    - using a then function you can used the second parameter to callback an error and that is can be set in the state/store.
    - If doing this from a real API on fetching the end point, depending on the repsonse e.g. response.ok/ statusCode 200 return json else return the status Text. On using the try and catch methods onComponentDidMount we error message can be stored in the store/state.

  - If you were to continue this application, what would you add?
    - use a reset style sheet for fallback
    - a pre-processor like Sass so I can add variables for colors, fonts, spacing etc. Or use styled components. Creating styling for mobile first.
    - add snapshot testing to reduce the number of tests that deal with matching props.
    - create something a bit more interactive and visually appealing like a Tooltip component for the email hover.
    - create timeconvertion into helper so it can be reusable.
    - creating a loader component with animated spinner
    - Add some kind off pagination or load more to reduce the amount of items viewed
    - find a better way of looping through both arrays and comparing them using array mapping and filter
  
  - If you were to deploy this application (or any web application) to production, how would you personally do it?

  
  - Finally, what did you think of the test? ðŸ˜€
